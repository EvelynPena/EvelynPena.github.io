# Evelyn Pena's Portfolio

Hello, my name is Evelyn Pena; welcome to my homepage. I'm an undergraduate student at CSUF studying in Computer Science. I expect to graduate by 2028

## CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1, Part 1

  Lab 1, part 1, was my favorite and most memorable project to work with because it was the first time I worked with using C++. It was also my first time coding a program using a terminal and VS Code. Although it was intimidating at first, the process of learning how to use the terminal and VS Code was enjoyable. Learning the commands of the terminal helped me further grow more confident and understanding of what to do in the other labs that would be introduced later throughout the course. Although it was a simple project, as a way to introduce us to the course, I enjoyed learning how to use the terminal and VS Code.

* Lab 6, Part 1

  Lab 6, Part 1, was also my favorite project since I liked using std::string to declare variables to make a sandwich and writing out the messages that printed out the error message and the sandwich order. Declaring the std::string variables was another part of the lab that I liked since before the start of the lab, I was unsure of how to declare a std::string variable, but learning how to declare a std::string variable made me a better understanding of how to a std::string variable. Although it was a short section, it helped me further understand how to print a message and declare a std::string variable.

* Lab 7, Part 1

  Lab 7, Part 1, was also my favorite to work on. Although it was more challenging to work on, figuring out what my partner and I had to do to write out our program made it easier since we would work together to try and figure out what to write for our program. Although we made many mistakes on our first draft of writing the code, it made understanding the lab simpler, furthering my understanding of std::string values.
